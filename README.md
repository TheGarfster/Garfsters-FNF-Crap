# Garfsters-FNF-Crap
UTAU Voicebanks, chromatic scales and SF2s (when possible), made for use for FNF mods and covers

Readmes of the voicebanks will list who originally voiced who as well as where I gathered the samples.

# Recommended
- For voicebanks: Fresamp
- For SF2s: LMMS, although you can use just about any program that supports them
- For chromatics: Just about any program that supports wav files
